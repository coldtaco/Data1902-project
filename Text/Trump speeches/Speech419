Donald Trump|Weekly Address: Donald Trump|Washington, DC
Senate Democrats call it the resistance â€“ theyre resisting the will of the american voter and it is not good.
From day one, Senate Democrats have shamelessly obstructed, stalled, and filibustered the confirmations of hundreds of talented men and women who are eager to come to Washington, D.C. to make a difference. They want to serve our country.
My nominees face a longer average confirmation wait than any in the history of our country. Today, more than 300 of our nominees are still awaiting a vote.
Last June, I nominated Isabel Patelunas to serve as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Intelligence and Analysis.
Now, almost a year later, this tremendously qualified professional with nearly three decades of intelligence experience is still awaiting confirmation. Shes given up so much. Shes left areas. Shes moved from homes and shes still not confirmed. Its a disgrace.
Democrats in Congress are also blocking urgently needed improvements to our border security. They dont want border security for two reasons. Number one, they dont care about it. Number two, they are afraid its going to make me and the republicans look good and they dont want that. That comes before our country.
They have blocked every effort to close deadly loopholes, to keep out vicious criminals, and to stop the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs. They are a disaster at the border. These actions are endangering our citizens, threatening our communities, and undermining our national security.
