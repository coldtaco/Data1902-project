Donald Trump|Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to the Press Before Marine One Departure|October 6, 2018
Were really looking forward to the vote. He will be a great justice of the Supreme Court. People have thought that for ten years. They thought -- hes is just an extraordinary person a great, great talent. And I think hes going to make us all very proud. I also feel very strongly that, in the end, it may be the process -- it was really unattractive, but the extra week was something that I think was really good.
I thought it was really good. I think a lot, of a lot of very positive things happened in the last week. It didnt look that way, but in the end thats what happened. It was uncorroborated. It was so many different things. Hes going in looking very good. But Ill have further comment later. I want to go. I want to watch the vote.
Im heading -- excuse me. Im heading out to Kansas. Kris Kobach is running for governor. Steve Watkins is running for Congress. We have a big crowd, and I look forward to it. Well be watching in a little while -- well be watching on television the vote, and the votes are very exciting. This is a very exciting time.
Any any time you have a chance to put a Supreme Court justice in position, and in this case I think hes going to be a great, great Supreme Court justice for many years. Its a very exciting time. So were going to Kansas. But well see you in a little while after the vote.
Say it again.
