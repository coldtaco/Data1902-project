Donald Trump|Remarks: Donald Trump and Mike Pence Speak Briefly After Arriving in Cleveland|July 20, 2016
Thank you everybody. This is really an honor. Were going to win Ohio, right? Come here, Mike. Were going to win Ohio. Were going to win it all. Going to Make America Great Again. Thats what we want to do. But the last time I got accused of speaking a little bit long, so this time we have to speak a lot short.
But I just want to introduce a man whos become a friend of mine. Somebody who is going to make an unbelievable vice president of the United States, Governor Mike Pence.
