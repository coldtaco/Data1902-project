Donald Trump|Speech: Donald Trump in Washington, DC|June 10, 2016
This is my third time. And I think the first time it was only OK. The second time I was great. And this time we have to top it, OK? Thank you all for being here. Before we begin, really, I want to thank Ralph Reed. Hes been an amazing -- just an amazing guy and amazing support. Terrific man.
And its a great honor to be invited and invited back so many times and Ill be here as often as I can, believe me, because Im with you a hundred percent. I also want to thank so many -- Ive had so much support. As you know, weve done very well with the evangelicals and with religion. Generally speaking, if you look at whats happened with all of the races, whether its in South Carolina, I went there and it was supposed to be very strong evangelical and I was not supposed to win and I won in a landslide.
And so many other places where you had evangelicals and we had the heavy Christian groups and it was just -- its been an amazing -- its been an amazing journey to us. I think we won 37 different states and the support that Ive had from you folks has been incredible and I appreciate it very much. I happen to be  Happened to be Presbyterian theres three of you out there.
Thats its been -- its been really something in some of my friends that are in the room I appreciate you being here. I want to really thank Jerry Falwell Jr. He was right from the beginning, hes been such a tremendous supporter of liberty as you know Liberty University jobs. Basketball life has been -- at -- right from the beginning.
Ive known it for so long that shes a tremendous person tremendous woman. Pastor Mark Burns, I dont know if youve watched him on television between him and Pastor Darrell Scott. These two guys theyre phenomenal. They have been so incredible. Robert Jeffress that we all know and love. Hes been amazing and in the audience I think we have Richard Lee.
we have Jim Garlow and we have Father Frank Pavone someplace there in the audience so I appreciate you. I appreciate you being here. And I have to say though, that the world is such a different place even from when I started with this. We started 12 months ago and coming up I just see where in France they have a massive soccer tournament something thats so important and so big and theyre thinking about maybe postponing it or canceling it because of threats and all the problems going on with whats happening with terrorism.
And its a very, very sad thing and a very sad place. And who would have ever thought our world would be in a position like this where that would happen but you just see event after event. Radical Islamic terrorism is just taking over and we cant let that happen. We cannot let that happen. And if were smart, and if were tough, we wont let it happen just remember.
OK. Its an honor to speak here today and discuss our shared values. Id like to thank all of the wonderful Christian leaders and Christian voters who have supported me. Weve had tremendous support. Here we are and here are the goals that I thought Id put some of these together and I did it just the other night because of this meeting and I wanted to come from me. From my heart.
We want to uphold the sanctity and dignity of life. Marriage and family as the building block of happiness and success. So as many, many very successful people are the happiest people the people that have that great religious feel and that incredible marriage, children, its more important than the money, folks.
Believe me I know plenty with lots of money and theyre not happy people. Religious freedom, the right of people of faith to freely practice their faith. So important. Yeah. Freedom of any kind means no one should be judged by their race or their color and the color of their skin should not be judged that way.
And right now we have a very divided nation. Were going to bring our nation together. I win when I bring . The importance of faith to United States aside is really the people who go to church, who work and work in religious charities, so important, and share their values. These are the foundations of our society.
We must continue to forge our partnership with Israel and work to ensure Israels security. Keeping people of faith safe from threats like radical Islam whether protecting them here or standing by Israel, all of us need to confront together the threat of radical Islam. We have to do it. Now, Hillary Clinton or as I call her crooked Hillary Clinton, refuses to even say the words radical Islam.
Refuses to say the words. This alone makes her unfit to be president. In fact -- in fact she wants a 500% increase in Syrian refugees to come into our country. No good. No good. Cant do it.  You know where they come from. Where they are.
Refugees are welcome here. Refugees are welcome.
Thank you very much. Its amazing.  All right. Thank you. Give them freedom of speech, please. Freedom of speech. Thank you. Very rude.  Thank you. Thank you, everyone. I appreciate it. Very sad. Very sad whats happening. Very, very sad. Whats happening our country is so sad, were so divided, its such a shame.
And by the way, these are professional agitators, folks. They come in, theyre sent here by the other party. But where we left, 500% increase in Syrian refugees without documentation. We dont know where they come from. Hillary will bring hundreds of thousands of refugees, many of whom have hostile beliefs about people of different faiths and values.
And some of whom absolutely and openly support terrorism in our country. We dont need that. We have enough problems. We have enough problems right now. Heres some of what we can accomplish together: Appoint judges, so important, who will uphold our laws, protect our constitution and protect the rights of all Americans.
And as you know, I put a list together of highly, highly respected judges and you will see and I think youve seen it and Im pretty sure you did but a lot of people have really come together over that list. Thats one of the most important reasons why we have to win the presidency. If we dont, its going to be a whole different country.
By the way this series is a real pro-life. [Cheering. We will restore respect for people of faith, who dutifully raise their children follow our laws and rules and we have to really take care of that. We have to take care of our neighbors because right now our neighbors are not being taken care of. We have to restore the rule of law on our border, in our government, no matter where it is, it has to be restored.
By the way, we have a great respect to our police and law enforcement . Theyre not being treated properly. So all this includes tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the office of the secretary of state, which it hasnt . Theyll be the worst dealmakers I have ever seen. If you look at the Iran deal, truly one of the worst deals Ive ever seen negotiated.
We will protect the right of churches to speak their minds on political matters free from intimidation.  controls to keep us safe from radical Islamic terrorism. Here is what Hillary Clinton would do to our country. Shell appoint radical judges, who will legislate from the bench overriding Congress and will -- And Ill tell you the will of the people will mean nothing, nothing.
Her judges will abolish the Second Amendment and destroy the rule of law. She wants to abolish the Second Amendment and I will tell you the National Rifle Association, the NRA, two weeks ago endorsed Donald Trump so... And I think its the earliest endorsement theyve ever given to a presidential candidate, so I was very honored.
Theyre great people, great people. She will keep Obamacare in place, which puts medical decisions in the hands of government. Not good. Obamacare, we will repeal and replace. Shell restrict religious freedom with government mandates. Shell push for federal funding of abortion on demand. Up until the moment of birth, which is where she is as you know.
She will undermine the wages of working people with uncontrolled immigration, creating poverty and income insecurity. Hillary Clintons Wall Street agenda will crush working families. Shell put bureaucrats, not parents, in charge of our lives and our childrens education, cant have it. Shell be trapping kids in failing schools.
Shell plunge our inner cities into even deeper poverty if thats possible. Hillarys agenda of taxation, and she wants to raise your taxes big league, folks, big league, get used to it. Here she wants to raise your taxes. Tremendous. Regulation bureaucracy, government control and open borders have economically destroyed our inner cities.
Her policies will be a crushing blow to all poor people in this country. Her education policies her economic policies, her immigration policies, and her trade policies will plunge our poor African-American and Hispanic communities into turmoil and even worse despair. Believe me, you look at whats going on. The Democrat Party has run the school boards and the police departments, and the city councils, and the mayors offices in most of our major cities, almost all of our inner cities.
Theyve run congressional offices. Theyve horribly failed in almost every single community. In fact, you could actually say in every community. Im going to turn things around. Hillary Clinton has jeopardized, totally jeopardized, national security by putting her emails on a private server, all to hide her corrupt dealings.
This is the reason she did it, folks. Its to hide your corrupt deals. Shes now under criminal investigation that was announced yesterday by the White House. I mean, its a criminal investigation. The first time ever by the way a president of the United States endorsed somebody under criminal investigation.
Interesting. She even appointed to the National Security Board someone with no national security experience. Instead he was a donor a recent donor to Hillary Clintons campaign and also gave as much as $250,000 dollars to this foundation. Theyre all -- Look, they said, "Where did this guy come from?" He made a contribution of 250,000. all of a sudden hes on his very important and vital board.
This decision dealt with tactical nuclear weapons and had top secret clearance he did nothing about it. Bill and Hillary made $153 million. Giving speeches to special interest groups since 2001. Thats a lot of money, thats a lot of money. These donors own Hillary Clinton. They own them. And Bernie Sanders was right about that.
I have to tell you. If you work -- Its true. The bottom line is, I will be working for you. I just spent $55 million running against with my money. Not easy. But I just spent 55 million of my money running in the primaries. Other people spent many times that amount and they didnt do so well. When I worked for you.
Im working for you. Im doing this because I  Together, friends, we will chart a new optimistic course for America. We will put America first. When you look at our deals, our military, our trade deals, all of this, we dont put America first. I dont think anybody negotiating these deals even knows anything about what they are doing and I dont think they care about America being first.
I care and you care and thats what its going to be. And thats a big part of why Im challenging Hillary Clinton today to replace her support for increased refugee admissions. We have to do it for a new jobs program for our inner cities. We have to take care of the people that are here. We have to temporarily stop this whole thing with whats going on with refugees where we dont know where they come from.
But we have to take a rest. We have to take a time out. We have to use the money to take care of our poorest Americans and work with them. So they can come out of this horrible situation that were in. We will restore faith to its proper mantle in our society. Thats what we have to do to have. We have to do that sooner.
We will respect and defend Christian Americans, Christian Americans. We will give parents control over their schools. So important. Well uphold the values our founders gave us, which were not doing now. We will work together to rebuild and restore and lift up everyone. Not a certain group, everyone, the whole country will lift up. We will make America great again for all Americans.
