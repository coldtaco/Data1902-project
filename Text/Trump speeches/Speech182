Donald Trump|Speech: Donald Trump in Tampa, FL|November 5, 2016
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
Thank you very much, folks. Now, we have a little difficulty because we have about 3,000 people, maybe 4,000 outside. Should we wait for them to come in?
No!
I agree. Lets get going. You people were here from, like, 2:00 in the morning, they tell me.
But were going to get going. Thank you very much. And we dont need Jay-Z to fill up arenas, you know. We do it the old-fashioned way. We do it the old-fashioned way, folks, we fill them up because you love what were saying and you want to make America great again. Thats about it.
And I actually like Jay-Z, but, you know, the language last night, oh, ooh. I was thinking, Maybe Ill just try it." Should I use that language if I want to...""nd I actually like Jay-Z
No!
Can you imagine if I said that? So -- he used every word in the book. I wont even use the initials because Ill get in trouble. Theyll get me in trouble. He used every word in the book last night.
And by the way, in Hershey, Pennsylvania, last night, we had an arena. We had 27,000 people show up, maybe they couldnt get in. Far more -- far more than Jay-Z had with their free tickets. Free tickets. Far more. And Beyonce. And I like them both. But he used language last night that was so bad, and then Hillary said, I did not like Donald Trumps lewd language." ""nd by the way
My lewd language. I tell you what -- Ive never said what he said in my life. But that shows you the phoniness of politicians and the phoniness of the whole system, folks.
In three days, we are going to win the great state of Florida.
And we are going to win back the White House.
Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare.
Its just been announced that the residents of Florida -- Im sorry to tell you this -- are going to experience a massive double-digit premium hike. And I know what it is. I say this to everybody. I know -- I just dont want to destroy the spirit in the room. Its going to be a massive hike. So, congratulations. Its not going to matter, because if we win, Im throwing it out anyway. So it doesnt make any difference. But get ready. Youre going to have a big, big, big hike. Hopefully, it wont make a damn bit of difference.
In the great state of Arizona, where I was just a couple of days ago and where Im going, premiums are going up by more than 116 percent.
Going to go higher than that. Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insure. And think of it. Theyre losing their insurers. Over 90 percent of the counties. And remember -- and most of you were there -- almost all of you felt this whole movement right from the beginning when we came down for the primaries, right? We won 66 out of 67 counties, 66 out of -- Florida is just a place I love. My second home. Im here all the time.
I might know Florida better than you do. But my second home. But we won 66 out of 67 counties. Thats never happened before. We almost -- we almost won that last one, too. And I see maybe even more enthusiasm right now than I did then. I think theres more enthusiasm.
You see the tremendous lines of people, and they have Trump hats on, make America great again. But they have Trump hats on and they have buttons and they have shirts, and theyre on line, and you see NBC, and you see these people...
Total phonies. The most dishonest people. And theyll say, it looks like its going -- there was one line where it was like 100 percent with Trump regalia. Now, maybe theyre in disguise, maybe theyre wearing buttons, shirts, and Trump hats, but theyre actually going to vote for crooked Hillary. Do you think thats possible?
No!
But you see these lines, and the woman says, Yes
So the great state of Texas, an incredible place. I go there. We have these massive crowds. And about two weeks ago, I was hearing the phonies in the media, and theyre going, very, very strongly, Texas is in play." Oh
Get em out, please. Get em out.
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
I must tell you, the Bernie Sanders protesters had much more enthusiasm and spirit than this one. The problem with these Hillary protesters is my people make all the noise. Theyre always going there, there. You cant even hear the person.
By the way, did you see -- before I get to Texas, did you see yesterday Obama screaming and screaming...
... and screaming? Just like the way he runs the country. Nobody listens to him. Screaming, OK? And I wanted to see the protesters, because these lying, thieving people back there, the media, they dont ever show -- they dont ever show my crowds.
I was saying to them the other night, Hershey, I was saying, Youve got to show -- youve got to turn the camera." They just -- every one of them right up my face
So last night, Obama had a protestor, and they wouldnt turn the camera to the protester. Its the first time Ive ever seen that. They kept it on him, but it was bad, because he kept screaming the same thing over and over again. And nobody would listen to him.
But they had the great state of Texas, so -- about three weeks ago, theyd say -- you know, they do these phony polls, right? Some of the polls are great. I only really acknowledge them if Im winning, so -- and by the way, were winning in a lot of polls!
A lot of polls.
We dont have enough time to talk about it now. Theres too many of them.
Oh, I love those signs, Blacks for Trump." Ho-ho-ho
Thats a great honor. Believe me, thats a great honor. So they kept saying, The great state of Texas is in play." Now
So then I get back, and three weeks ago, Texas is in play. Its even." And I say
A guy gets on two days ago, a man named Sid Miller. Dont really know him. Wearing a big, beautiful, white cowboy hat. In fact, I want to find out where he got it. Its pretty nice. And he said, You know
So, Texas, were just absolutely -- were doing great in Texas. But were doing great in New Hampshire. Were doing great in Iowa. Were doing great in Ohio. Ohio. Just left, going back again soon. Doing phenomenally well in North Carolina.
I think were going to win Pennsylvania.
I think were going to win Pennsylvania. Were right there. I saw they had -- you know, and even is not, like, my thing. You know, were even. But they had me way down in Pennsylvania, then last night, Im looking, two or three polls came out. Jim
