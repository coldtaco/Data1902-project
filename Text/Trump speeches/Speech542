So, I want to thank you very much. Youre a very special group of people. I just look at you, look how healthy and how strong and how good. And we really appreciate it. We appreciate it very much.
So this was a scheduled visit from a number of months ago. We went from the G20, and I promised your President, President Moon, who is a friend of mine -- I said, "We have to see the DMZ." And so this was scheduled for a long time ago. And then, yesterday, I had the idea, "Maybe Ill call Chairman Kim and see if he wants to say hello." So we didnt give him much notice, but weve become -- we respect each other.
We respect each other. Maybe even like each other. And hes agreed to meet. And Im going to meet him in about four minutes. So Im going to cut my speech a little bit short, other than to say you are terrific people. Youve done a fantastic job. And were with you all the way. You know that. What do you have over there? That looks good.
Oh? Whos a golfer? Huh?
Ill use it.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Ill be thinking about you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thats great.
