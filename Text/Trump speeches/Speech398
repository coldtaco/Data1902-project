Donald Trump|Weekly Address: Donald Trump|Washington, DC
My fellow Americans. This week, we continue to hear from more citizens benefiting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, with more money in their paychecks, and hope for an even more prosperous future.
The fact is, theyre doing better theyre spending money and theyre saving money like they havent before all because of these great tax cuts.
Lauren Ray Kovac wrote to say that she and her husband are registered Democrats, and after years of financial struggles, the economy is finally delivering for them. Theyre doing well again. Theyre happy. The Kovacs 401k is now growing, and they have an extra $165 in each paycheck. Thats thousands of dollars a year.
While Nancy Pelosi calls this crumbs, Lauren sees it as grocery shopping all year long. Its a lot of money for Lauren and a lot of money for our family. Its called living better.
As Lauren says, every little bit helps -- and this is more than a little bit. Well Lauren, like every hard-working American, you deserve to keep more of your money, and you worked hard to get it. Now youre keeping it.
If you agree, share your story of American success and the pride in your paycheck at whitehouse.gov/contact. Do it now. Maybe well be reading your story. And you know what? There are a lot of great stories out there right now, because people are happy. Theyre making a lot more money.
