The job youve done is incredible. And were with you all the way. We -- I can tell you, weve sent you a lot of equipment over the last two and half years -- getting close to three years, hard to believe. But a lot of equipment came your way. A lot of equipment that wasnt being used came your way -- the military equipment that you have that wasnt going to be distributed for some reason.
Someday, somebody will explain why. But that was the way it was. But it was a lot different. And you deserve it. But we are with you 100 percent. And the Chief knows: Any problems, he just calls me and Im there. You know that, right?
