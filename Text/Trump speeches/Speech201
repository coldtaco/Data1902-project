As you can see on the problem right now, as you can see on the problem right now, as you can see right before our eyes, Im pretty for a right before our eyes, Im pretty for a right before our eyes. Im pretty - for a company with yes, that product that makes company with, yes, that product that makes company with yes, that product that makes sense because Im sure its never happened.
Im - because Im sure its never happened. Im - because Im sure its never happened. Im sure its never ever happened in the sure its never ever happened in the sure its never ever happened in the history of our country. But I can see history of our country, but I can see history of our country. But I can see somebody approving a deal that they - somebody approving a deal that they - somebody approving a deal that they shouldnt approve and then getting maybe shouldnt approve.
And then getting - maybe shouldnt approve and then getting maybe prior to that approval, right, look, hes prior to that approval, right? Look, hes prior to that approval, right? Look, hes taken is that this guys a great taken is that this guys a great taken is that this guys a great businessman, he say absolute right 100 businessman, he say absolute right 100 businessman, he say absolute right 100 percent.

After youre finished, like how about next year, youre finished, like how about next year youre finished, like how about next year, how about next month? Lets get this. How about next month?
Lets get this. How about next month? Lets get this finished. So then all of a sudden you get finished, so then all of a sudden you get finished. So then all of a sudden you get stuck with a horrible contract and these stuck with a horrible contract and these stuck with a horrible contract and these people go off even if its two years or people go off even if its two years or people go Off even if its two years or five years, I dont think they should five years, I dont think they should five years.
I dont think they should ever be allowed to work for these ever be allowed to work for these ever be allowed to work for these companies. And if they take the job and companies and if they take the job and companies and if they take the job and they know that its fair, but Ill bet they know that its fair, but Ill bet they know that its fair.
