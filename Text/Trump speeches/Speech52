Donald Trump|Speech: Donald Trump in Fayetteville, NC|August 9, 2016
it is a distinct honor and a great privilege to present to you the next
president of the United States Donald Trump
back here was that a great introduction I mean an offer and hes known me for a
long time i used to have to get those zoning approvals from in New York they
were tough he is a great guy what a great introduction
its always nice thank you you know we had one day to set this up look at this
place
we had one day one day were gonna do great in North Carolina we just left
we just left you know where we were and the crowds were getting here amazing
know the enthusiasm is so incredible
but you know what is nice when you have people like Rudy that really know you
and they speak from the heart as opposed to every once in awhile and theyre very
nice to get up and they have endorsed you were there with you but they dont
know you fact youve only known her for about 12 minutes right and they say
Donald Trump button this and that and doesnt mean the same Ive known ready
for I guess close to 30 years I hate to admit that long because its like a long
time but Ive known for a long time and he was a great mayor did a great job and
everything hes ever done and a special guy and I hope that if I win were going
to be taking him and chris Christie and general Flynn migrate sheriff out there
we have a so many different so many different people that are on this
campaign we have were loaded up with great sheriffs and great people you know
we have just amazing people were gonna be bringing fantastic people on board
and Ive gotten to know so many people doing this and one but somebody said
before you know you should mention some of the people ben Carson such an
incredible guy
great
hes a great person great human being and some of the people that in all
fairness you know we had 17 people some of the people i ran against they got to
know him and theyre good i didnt treat him very nicely but thats ok you know
thats all but were gonna bring a lot of the people that you know a lot of
people that you respect and were going to do it based on talent based on all of
the things that we need for the different positions we have such talent
in this country were not using it
were just not using it such incredible talent and speaking of talent
so whats with this voter ID in north carolina right
whats with this
you know I keep talking about rigged system i watch Bernie Sanders work work
work for old burning hes working working working and i said i think the
systems rigged you know the super-delegates what happened to Bernie
where is you what happened but were gonna get a lot of Bernie voters I think
we really well because I talk about trade and Ive been talking about it for
years many years before i was doing this have been doing this for like what 15
months now
before long before I was doing this I was talking about trade and what a
disgusting situation it is for our country you know that two days ago I met
a supporter and hes in the tile business great guy but he said his
business is being decimated by foreign countries with a make tile and the
towels not nearly as good and he cant send his tile to those countries because
theres a 27-percent tax and its very tough but they can send their stuff in
here and there stuff by the way is not as good as what this man makes and you
know the trade thing its all like we talked about free trade and I want trade
and im not in isolation is by the way i want free trade but i wanted to be great
trade for our country
its got to be a two-way street its got to be a to waste and it will be a
two-way street again it will be a two-way street but he was telling me how
impossible it was for him in this case it was China but its really almost
everybody how impossible it was for him to do business in China and not for long
and will do business in China were going to do business in China but were
going to do it on an equal footing right now they can dump their product and you
know what im talking about the steel they dump and I think they dumped it to
put our steel companies out of business so that we have to go to China to buy
the stuff and you know what
not gonna happen anymore folks its not going to happen anyway
and if you think Hillary Clinton knows anything about it number one I know
about it but even if she did it wouldnt matter because shes controlled by her
donors and her special interests
totally controlled by her donors and special interest so if she knew it
wouldnt make any difference wouldnt make any difference whatsoever so were
going to bring back our trade you know somebody said to me whats the most
important well theres so many things we got a repeal Obamacare replace it we
gotta have strong borders at me theres so many things you can go on and on and
on he could stand here for three days we can tell you whats wrong and so many of
these things are so easy to fix one of the things that amazes me when I talk
about trade I want to trade i think its good
the concept of trip its got to be fair but heres the thing i say im going to
renegotiate NAFTA which is a disaster right by the way in North Carolina and
virtually every other place in all fairness but they have ripped businesses
from your guts
theyve taken businesses out of this state out of Ohio out of michigan
michigan has just been decimated by after the auto plans youve got to see
what theyre building in Mexico they are building some of the greatest biggest
most modern plants in the world for cars for computers for everything and you
know what folks I think thats fine but were not going to help them
were going to fight for ourselves were gonna have a policy very simple America
first remember that America
so we have essentially two people running and Hillary made it through a
small field I made it through a large field and she got through I got through
were stuck with each other just fine and Ill tell you what if you knew where
she stood on the 2nd amendment on the raising which you basically wants to
take your safety way she wants to take your guns away and by the way if she
appoints Supreme Court justices meeting if she gets the option to a point
meaning a very sad day in this country because if she became president should
do a terrible job this would be four more years of obama and we dont want
four more years of Obama we dont want Isis we dont want regulations we dont
want high taxes all of these things would would be an extension this would
be an extension a four-year extension of obama and i think in many ways it maybe
end up being worse so if she gets to a point Supreme Court justices you know
the next president will appoint probably three but it could even be four or five
thats the way the cards for will be a record setting number possibly and we
had judge Kelly as an example that was supposed to be Justice Scalia was
supposed to be there for a lot longer and that he was taken from us and he was
a great guy and we are going to appoint justices you know I named 11 people that
are highly highly vented highly vented heritage and different people and gone
through different people that I respect conservative people smart people and
very importantly and the wheel standard if we could find as close to Justice
Scalia because he was a terrific United States
Supreme Court change now if on the other hand if Hillary points if Hillary points
justices of the Supreme Court you can have a lot of problems folks you can
have a lot of problems because you know if theyre on the court for 20 or 25
years and you have four of them lets say or three of them or five of them
I mean weve gone for like what 75 years meaning were gone as a country because
we will be a large scale version of Venezuela thats whats gonna happen and
you see whats happening in vent as well so we cant let it happen
we cant let it happen now just a couple of things and I wrote these down a week
ago and Ive said it and I mean it but I said unstable Hillary Clinton lacks the
judgment remember when Bernie Sanders talked about judgment he said she has
bad judgment
now what he said it nobody picked it up and when I say it nobody picks it up
either because you cant say a bad because the press will never pick up
anything thats correct or accurate or bad about it now its such it is such a
double standard but Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton had bad judgment
and he said it many times and he said it over and over and then I think he was
really asked not to say that anymore and he stopped because they were perhaps
more civil that we were in our site we would never stop but shes bad judgment
her temperament a word she uses all the time is terrible
its a losers temperament shes got the temperament of a loser i have the
temperament of a winner and we have to win again
we have to win
she said about me not so long ago my tone she said I dont like two tone t.o
n.e I dont like the tone of Donald Trump now in the Middle East theyre
chopping off heads theyre drowning people in steel cages theyre burying
people in the sand and she doesnt like my tone I think its time maybe for a
little tougher tone folks you know no time for
so the bad judgment alone you cant pick a hill look whether you look at Libya
you look at Syria you take a look at the migration take a look at this
she wants to put and I said five hundred percent and the press that I was wrong
it wasnt the right number five hundred percent more people coming in from Syria
we dont know who they are where they come from
she wants and I said five hundred percent more than President Obama and
hes got a pouring in right and the press that I was wrong you know what the
real number was 550 percent i couldnt believe it i was on the low side that
was on the low side 550 percent more than we have coming in right now and you
know what this is going to be in my opinion and Ive been pretty right of
these things I said dont go into Iraq was right about it i said and by the way
once we were in Iraq getting out the way Obama got out cause problems that are
going to be very hard to solve
i said i reparable what they have done what they have done in terms of getting
out of Iraq Isis comes about you know i said before also in North Carolina I
said that if they gave a trophy for the most valuable player you call it in
sports most pack valuable player award the winner of the trophy for Isis would
probably have to be Hillary click right Hilary clone
and now shes gonna tell you how to get rid of Isis shes gonna tell you how
cause her and Obama and I guarantee you that if Obama had the choice to do again
now you have to go and play the game but if he had the choice to do again for
Secretary of State and if he knew what took place in the Middle East and other
places i guarantee you he would never have picked Hillary Clinton he would
never picked her he would not have gone that way now youre not going to hear
that im sure he tells that to his wife but its about it because he cant but
thats the way it is
Shoshi she is just a person that if shes president were gonna have
problems like youve never had before she talks about toughness with Russia
wouldnt it be nice if we actually got along with people will not be a nice
thing
ok you know Russia is a nuclear nation has nuclear weapons you know shes tough
they talk about Crimea i answered a question perfectly they were talking
about Russian what I would do with Ukraine and Russia but you know by the
time this is now taking place
Crimea is already a part of Russia essentially right and this happened on
Obamas watch so they put out a thing about me I didnt know foreign policy i
didnt know foreign policy
why did you let Crimea go to Russia they dont want to mention this they dont
want to mention the fact that when i was asked about NATO that I said look NATOs
obsolete now im not an expert on NATO but I have a lot of common sense i have
great business sense i made a lot of money and I had great success
but but you know what built a great great company far greater than anybody
even understands but but you know what I said
NATOs absolutely and they all smiled and laughed Oh Donald Trump he said its
obsolete
dont forget this was done for the Soviet Union many many many years ago
now lets say Russia tough so its ok for Russia to right lets say its fine
but this was done originally for the Soviet Union it morphs into Russia
thats fine but we have a new threat its called terrorism and then not
equipped for terrorism they dont even have the right countries for terrorism
and i said this actually to Wolf Blitzer CNN but I said this and people smiled
how that that funny isnt that funny
three days later they start saying Trump is right its really obsolete you know
you ever hear the expression you cant see the forest for the trees right right
you cant see the forest for the trees you guys good people they study need to
this so close theyre so close that they cant see whats going on
so all of a sudden 34 days later somebody came out that your trucks got
a point and then a couple of months ago on the wall street journal of the front
page I read because I said terrorism its absolutely because its not
covering terrorism the way it should be and then all of a sudden i read a big
story from picture of the wall street journal Nate out to develop terrorism
division
and I was only mentioned like 18 of one sense that I essentially wasnt happy
they could give me a little more credit but that saturday the credit I want our
country to be great again thats what i really want thats what
but then I said a second thing with them i said a second thing thank you thank
you very much i said a second thing within I said we have too many countries
that are paying their way because i had heard it and I dont study it i mean
that NATO was aight ill tell you what when I was asked a question about NATO I
give you my word its not I you know Im a business guy in in my whole life I was
never asked about NATO right but I gave a great answer and theyve actually
changed NATO because of what i said ok now its not because of what i said
because of what we said you know folks just so you know something we have a
movement going on here
this is a movement this is
this is a real great movement this is a beautiful thing to watch no matter where
we go the crowds the enthusiasm I mean this thing we started today
here I said lets stop there its great i have a friend that lives in the area I
said alright ill come up
I mean its amazing and by the way I love the military is this military or
why i love the world and and were gonna take care of the military
were going to take care of the military you know I have to say Im in a lot of
businesses but im in the real estate business primarily and i get so many
listings of military bases this ones for sale that ones and at one point few
years ago I said wow how many bases can we sell you know theyre getting rid of
so many places in so many bases and you know the one thing im a big believer in
cutting and we can do a lot of cutting and a lot of pruning and have things be
better look at the VA as an example how badly run is the VA how badly run is the
VA and yet its like a corrupt enterprise but how badly run is that and
thats not just a question of money
its a question of management its a question of style our veterans are not
being treated as well as a lot of people that come into our country illegally
yeah
on by the way they said my wife Melania might have come in illegally can you
believe that one
no no they said headlines maybe she came in illegally maybe let me tell you one
thing she has got its are documented so shes gonna have a little news
conference over the next couple weeks s good thats good i love it I love it
they said a lot of Trump may have come into our country illegally and how would
that be for Donald Trump to be tucked is the only problem she came in totally
legally i may get outside so I was like all right but youll see it a little
well I said to her no no let it simmer for a little while let them go while let
it simmer and then lets have a little news conference and absolutely but they
have to come in and by the way we want people to come in to our country but
they have to come in Legally they have to come in
wriggle
yeah
now
Hillary Clinton I just have to go because these facts are pretty obvious
but we have to go from like one last time because were dealing with a person
that doesnt know how to tell the truth
were dealing with a very dishonest human being you know remember the word
you remember the word short-circuit can you imagine if i said i had a
short-circuit headlines all over the world right with hurts a little story
fact i watch that interview with chris wallace at Fox I watched it and I saw
her say lots of bad things you know I mean like lots of bad things
the lie on the lie on the lime it got to be like multiples right so many things
how did you get away with it her greatest achievement in life will be
getting away with what she got away with thats in my opinion
I see this guy Blagojevich and I know him because he was on the apprentice
right
the guys got in jail for 14 years and he just I guess lost an appeal today or
something
hes in jail for 14 years and Hillary Clinton is allowed to delete 33,000
emails think of that think of that
whats going on whats going on
yeah
haha
Sen said anonymously folks its a very said situation our country has been set
back the world watch that whole situation that world has been watching
and its very very bad and Ill tell you what its big so badly so badly of our
country because everybody knows that she should not be running for the Presidency
right now she should not be running everybody knows that go over a couple of
the go over a couple of the statements will do it quickly because you know it
looks and now they say the foundation the foundation well then I get together
of that theyre not going to do anything with the foundation right now look at
the foundation give me a break
Hillary Clinton claim the reason for her illegal use of private insecure email
totally insecure was that it was more convenient to use just one device
ok fact the FBI director said Hillary use several devices and numerous mobile
devices
therefore it was a lie false statement number two I mean we go we could go fall
second number 30
hey what you love to see what some of those 33,000
when you love to say that I tell you its very its very very honestly its a
very sad situation very sad situation but have you get away with it you say by
the way we wont be giving in thirty-three thousand emails but we
subpoenaed the emails i assumed they subpoenaed them right
we want the emails oh well we delete 33,000 oh well thats okay thats fine
no problem
can you imagine if somebody else do that here till tell Petraeus submitted false
statement number two in her testimony to congress Hillary Clinton said she turned
over all of her work-related emails all of the FBI director said Hillary failed
to turn over several thousand work-related emails including some
emails that were classified whats going on and whats going on
false statement number three in her testimony to congress Hillary Clinton
said there was nothing marked classified on my email either spent received app
you not thats false and thats been proven and I could go all h2 page after
page and wont ever change folks we have a person thats very dishonest we have a
person that shouldnt be able to run we have a person that how she escaped this
unbelievable situation is considered one of the great wonders of the world
Ill tell you right now said its very said so look a few things Hillary
comparison wants to raise taxes tremendously Trump Trump thats me
Trump wants to lower them very substantially you saw that
Hillary crooked Hillary she is crooked as a three-dollar bill crooked Hillary
wants to expand regulations and by the way regulations my opinion and I go
around im all over the country meet unbelievable people if they had a choice
of having their taxes reduced or their regulations pretty much wiped out to a
large extent i mean we need certain regulations environmental we need and
you know we need certain but we have it so excessive you can start businesses
you cant keep is going to find out that people would rather have his reaches
substantially then have their taxes reduced and were just about the highest
tax nation in the world that tells you whats going on
alright Hillary Clinton wants to shut down energy production she wants to fire
get rid of all the miners he doesnt want any minus any minors in here by the
way now were going to expand energy were going to expend all forms of
energy but were going to expand energy right are right Hilary think of this
Hillary once our look at that she wants to . far-left judges who will destroy
back and stripped I want judges who will support and defend our Constitution
right Hilary wants to open our borders and I want to have strong borders and
were going to have the wall and Mexicos gonna pay for the wall right
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
I have to say its very interesting because a lot of the people the
politicians that idea what they come to me and they say Donald you dont really
mean bill to work you know theyre not in the construction business like I am
and like some of the people they really mean it too i mean they made it they
wouldnt have any any chance of building because they wouldnt know where to
begin but they come up and they say you dont really mean youre gonna build a
wall do you youre kidding right you know you can I said not now its easy
precast blank being boom see the ceiling that stealing is a little low compared
to this wall not a low ceiling too little out compared to our wall but
think of it so they come up to me and they really made it theyre good people
they come up some are good people actually but they come see really build
a convincing me really easy goes fast
by the way over 12 version up but never see these highways where they put up the
walls along the highways it always amazed me somebody buys a house along
the highway so they know what theyre buying right they do you know what Im
about to say the money that we waste so they buy a house and its along a
highway and highways a little noisy little everything but thats why they
brought the acid wait for a low price because they dont want to be along a
highway they dont want the the whatever it is that they dont want the noise so
they buy this house and they happen and theyre fine and then they get the
government to build a wall and make the house more valuable in the government
spends a fortune in the world but take those walls and they go up like magic
now make it much much bigger
okay i dont mean a little bit bigger I mean like if you get up there man you
dont wanna you want to be very careful getting down and walls to work just ask
Israel how to walzwerk Israel they work
right right all you have to do is ask ask is real about what I ask is really
about what
so were gonna build a wall and I also tell these folks when they come up and
they talk about its impossible to build a wall right you know and I really made
it look at the highways they build these things all over the place I dont even
know why I dont know what they built so many of them theyre putting them all
over the place I want somebody thats you know whats gonna help us
ok its going to help us but were going to build a wall then they come up and
they say you cant do it nicely away take a look at China they have a thing
called the Great Wall of China I dont know if anybodys ever little wall that
goes 13,000 miles right 13,000 miles the Great Wall of China 13,000 you know what
13,000 miles is i mean were talking about a serious wall were talking about
a wall like there is no wall
whats canada like five or six thousand right so were talking about really much
more than twice canada along canada so here we have a situation with
politicians are telling me about the 1i refer them back 2,000 years
this wall was built 2,000 years ago this by the way if anyone has ever seen the
grip of Chinas a serious wall
this is not a wall built with hydraulic equipment this was built with hydraulic
muscles so its 13,000 miles and was built 2,000 years ago so we have 2,000
miles of which we really need only 1000 because we have a lot of natural borders
right we have a lot of natural barriers and so we have thousands of US China had
13,000 we have and we can use caterpillar tractors im not using
komatsu by the way
or will use John Deere tractors right you like John what will use Jacobson you
know Jacobson good company i use Jacobson to i use a lot you know how
much john deere & Jacobson equipment i bought over the years and Jacobsons
here to you know that right there I have it I have a very big property right have
a very very big property in North Carolina and I have John Deere and I
have Jacobson i have all but I bought millions and millions and millions of
dollars of equipment millions of dollars worth of equipment and I try when i can
divide made in the USA i try sometimes you cant because sometimes they devalue
the dollar or the their currency so much they devalue like China is the Grand
Master of devaluation and so now other countries Im it doesnt take so much to
figure it out what takes a lot is to get away with it because what they do is
cheating and i want to buy when we can made-in-the-usa remember the old days we
have to send we had science made in the USA made in America was like us have you
seen and what happened to it I think if i win were gonna sort of go back to
made in the USA or made in America
its true we dont see that anymore right you dont see that used to be a
sign of quality when you had a car when you had something made in the USA made
in America both up and you dont see him anymore
were gonna go back is were gonna make so many things again folks were not
making product anymore
our plants i tell the story all the time because to me its a great story
I have a friend whos probably in the world the biggest builder of plants he
built the plants thats what he does great guy and he does plans master plans
for cars for computers for like anything if its a plant he builds it and I said
how are you doing he said Im doing good business is good really has the United
States doing not so great i said well hows business good he said Donald
youve got to see whats happening in Mexico whats happening in Mexico is the
eighth wonder of the world
were building some of the biggest most beautiful plants youve ever seen
hed rather build them here ok hed much rather building here but thats not the
way our government works because we allow this to happen and theyre taking
our businesses from North Carolina and from all these other states Ohio big
lake michigan tremendous what theyre doing theyre taken all of them theyre
taking tremendous auto business you look at Ford you look at these other car
companies and theyre going there and were like sort of left holding the bag
thats not going to happen anymore folks okay not gonna happen now so they say
and Ive been watching Ive been watching for years Ive been watching
for years and Ive been seeing our country our government officials who
dont know what theyre doing all sorts of tax abatements and low-interest loans
and zero interest loans and theyll give us zero interest loan and somebody will
move anyway theyll say that
lets get ready they forgot to put a restrictive covenant but Ive been
watching them fight moving companies for so long and all you have to do is use
the example of carrier they build air conditions they announced to
indianapolis indiana a place that I love because we had such a big victory and
Bobby Knight really helped i will tell you Lou Holtz and so many others but
Bobby Knight
was in there campaigning with me but we had a big victory we want to miss a
victory there and one of the reasons was carrier fired their employees the moving
to Mexico and heres how you stop the folks you say im going to charge a
35-percent tax and every air conditioner that you make and sell into the United
States and go through a very strong border by the way and heres what
happens number one of you say it soon enough
nobody leaves now lets say somebody called me ten years ago and they put me
in charge of companies not leaving the United States ok thats my official i am
secretary of companies not leaving the United States I dont think one company
would have left the United States ok i really dont i might not have been nice
who cares its like some of the people that I have negotiated i will have we
have some of the greatest business leaders in the world that have endorsed
me and they want me to win because they know i know what im talking about and
we will use these people some of them are not nice people do we care we have
very nice people right now we have such nice people that they dont put America
first they put American night they dont care about America many of our political
hacks many are diplomats that have no understanding of business or anything
else so heres the story folks we are going to stop this barage of companies
leave you have people right now in this room think they have a good job and
their companies negotiating to move to Mexico or another place or their company
is being taken over by China or and then it would be closed and theyll take the
product but Chinas even do that they just sell things into the country and
you want to try doing business in China its almost impossible because they make
it so difficult to get your product and i have friends and manufacturers they
cannot get their product in and if they do get into have to pay a massive tax
and your China comes in so we have a 500 billion dollar trade deficit with china
we have a tremendous trade deficit like around 60 billion with Mexico thats why
when I say Mexico will pay for the wall everyone so you have to be well the
trade deficit is massive compared to the cost of the wall and were talking about
we lose so much money on trade with Mexico and thats not including the
drugs that poor across the border were not including that thats a separate
category and were going to stop that
and by the way border patrol the border patrol ages of our country 16,500 have
endorsed me theyve never endorse the presidential because were not going to
play games and sheriff joe arpaio of Arizona sheriff joe endorsement thats
pretty so we can have strong borders will have strong borders
were gonna have great radius were going to renegotiate after and were
gonna make deals instead of taking our companys were gonna make the deal
stare and if they dont think ill tell you honestly very simple if they dont
want to renegotiate you know whats gonna happen bye-bye
were finished were finished that was the deal signed by bill clinton and he
never had suffered the ravages because he left that to others but I looked at
new england when I was campaigning I got to know so much about this country much
more than I ever thought I could even fathom I got to know the people of
states even upstate New York I know New York but i got to know the people
upstate New York and a different parts of Long Island that were absolutely its
ravaged whats happened is horrible
you see factories use but beautiful and theyre literally falling apart this
what app music that I what factories by the thousands and tens of thousands and
now theyre all either unemployed or having jobs that arent as good as an
example many people in this room made more money eighteen years ago
ok and they didnt work as hard as theyre working out and now they have in
many cases two jobs and thats why we have the crowds and thats why we have
the movement and thats why were going to win in November II i really believe
now for the military people in the room
were doing great with the military i think were going to win the military
like is anyone not gonna vote for is any military people in the room ratio who is
going to vote for Trump of the military people in the room i think it looks like
a very similar I think and you know who else likes from the police
we have so many endorsements from the police the police are not treated
properly they are not treated properly so heres the story folks were going to
make our country great again and were gonna be thought of as the smart country
again and were gonna have a good relationship I have great relations with
China i cant believe i just signed a lease extension with the largest bank in
the world that happens to be in China largest in the world and i said to my
people you sure they want because I hit him pretty hard but this is nothing
personal you know like on the apprentice that I did rather successful i said its
not personal its just business expect you know its one of those things but I
said you sure they want to say yeah and I brought the people in my office top
executives its a good Im glad youre signing you are somethin arent you
returning I said thats okay you know its a great location and send somebody
else if I had to but they want to resend at least they were there
just extended the lace and they say known as the drop in China we have great
respect for you because you tell the truth can you believe that is that great
so so were going to help the NRA who are great people and theyre fighting
heart theyre fighting hard
Chris and wayne and all of the people at the NRA these are people that love our
country but the Second Amendment is under siege
believe me if Hillary Clinton gets in the Second Amendment it is under siege
and thats a very important so heres the story folks heres the story we are
going to make America great again we are going to make America strong again we
are going to make America safe again and we are going to have a policy of america
first okay
and on november $YEAR 8 ill be back Ill be back so much to North Carolina
because this is very important you are gonna get so sick and tired of me
you can watch those phony Hillary Clinton ads all over television with
wall street money and a lot of people and let me to the insert false by the
way thats just men mostly falls but let me just tell you Im gonna be back a lot
im gonna be back so much that youre gonna say please please dont come back
anymore will vote for you please please
but i just want to thank the people of North Carolina were gonna have a
tremendous victory in November a ill be back a lot
thank you everyone god bless you thank you
