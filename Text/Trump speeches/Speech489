So Ill be going to Kansas City. Well be traveling to Missouri. Im making a speech on law enforcement. Very important subject. I want to confirm that Bill Barr, one of the most respected jurists in the country, highly respected lawyer, former Attorney General under the Bush administration, a terrific man, a terrific person, a brilliant man.
I did not know him for -- until recently, when I went through the process of looking at people, and he was my first choice from day one. Respected by Republicans and respected by Democrats. He will be nominated for the United States Attorney General and hopefully that process will go very quickly, and I think it will go very quickly, and Ive seen very good things about him, even over the last day or so, when people thought that it might be Bill Barr.
So Bill Bar will be nominated or the United States Attorney General position. I think he will serve with great distinction.
