Donald Trump|Press Gaggle: Donald Trump Speaks to Reporters in Topeka, Kansas|October 6, 2018
So the vote is now in, and our country has a truly great new Supreme Court justice. Were very honored by it. Hes -- hes an outstanding man, an outstanding person. What they put him and his family through the Democrats over the last few weeks is horrible.
If you look at what hes had to endure, horrible. False statements. Just, it doesnt get any worse. But the beautiful thing is he is now in. Hes going to be there for a long time, and hes just an outstanding intellect, outstanding scholar, brilliant lawyer, brilliant at everything hes ever done. So were very happy. And the vote was a -- it was a great vote, a very historic vote.
I just spoke to just -- I just spoke to him two minutes ago. And, I spoke to the justices family, and hes so excited. So -- we have now Justice Kavanaugh, and hes a terrific man, terrific person.
I just congratulated him. I said, "Congratulations, that was well fought." I mean who would have thought a thing like that could have happened what hes been through. Everything was uncorroborated.
I want to thank the FBI. I thought the FBI was incredible. They worked hard, and they worked really fast, and I hear the report was -- was really, detailed, thorough, professional report. So I wanted to thank them.
I want to thank the Justice Department, because they also -- they were working along with the FBI really hard, really fast, and I think this actually -- the extra week delay was a was a terrific thing for the process.
So we have a great new Supreme Court justice, and hes going to be there for many years. We are very, very proud of him, and what he and his family had to endure. And its a -- its a great testament, and its a testament also to our country.
Im going to make a speech. Ill be talking about it a little bit. I know youll all be there. So thank you very much. Thank you.
