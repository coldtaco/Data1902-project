Donald Trump|Speech: Donald Trump Delivers Remarks On the Opioid Crisis|March 19, 2018
Thank you to our First Lady, Melania, who has been so incredible.  Thank you. And we are blessed to have you as our First Lady. Really are.
Its great to be back in the beautiful state of New Hampshire.  I dont know if you remember, but this is the first place I came for the primaries.  And this is the room right here. So I like this room. This has been a good room.
Were honored to be joined by your wonderful and very talented Governor, Chris Sununu. Chris, thank you.  Thank you, Chris. Oh, and theres another talented governor. Governor Sununu, stand up.  I have to tell you, there was nobody tougher on Trump at the beginning.
Its true. There was nobody on television tougher. And then we met each other and we liked each other, and he went from the worst to the best. Governor, thank you. I mean that, too. Thank you.
I want to thank also Attorney General Sessions, and Secretary -- thank you, Jeff. --  -- Secretary Azar, Secretary Nielsen, and Surgeon General Adams for joining us at this very important event.
The First Lady and I just visited the Manchester Fire Department Safe Station. Talking about it all over the country. The Fire Chief, Dan Goonan, and all of the first responders with us today, thank you. Youve been incredible, and youre saving American lives.
Were also joined by a number of law enforcement officers who we love. Our police, DEA, ICE, Border Patrol agents, and Customs officers work night and day to keep drugs out of our communities and criminals off of our streets.
So today, we thank you, we honor you, and we want you to know that we will always have your backs 100 percent. Thank you very much, law enforcement. Thank you.
I especially want to acknowledge all of the families with us today who have endured terrible hardships because of the opioid crisis, and especially those who have lost precious loved ones.
Ive been saying this for a long time, and it all started right here in New Hampshire, because I see what youre going through. About as bad as there is anywhere in the country. And I said Id be back, and we are back. And were pouring a lot of money and a lot of talent into this horrible problem. And we pledge to honor the memory of those you lost with action and determination and resolve.
Well get it. We will not rest until the end. And I will tell you, this scourge of drug addiction in America will stop. It will stop.
Every day, 116 Americans die from an opioid-related overdose. In New Hampshire, the overdose, really, death rate -- I mean, can you believe this? The death rate is double the national average. Its got difficulties like people wouldnt believe.
Defeating this epidemic will require the commitment of every state, local, and federal agency. Failure is not an option. Addiction is not our future. We will liberate our country from this crisis. Never been like this. Hundreds of years -- never been like this. And we will raise a drug-free generation of American children.
Last October, we declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency. Should have been done a long time before. Since then, weve worked with Congress to ensure at least 6 billion additional dollars, going through right now, in new funding in 2018 and 2019 to combat the opioid crisis. And we will be spending the most money ever on the opioid crisis.
On our most recent National Prescription Drug Take Back Day, people across the country turned in more than 900,000 pounds of unused or expired prescription drugs -- more than the weight of three Boeing 757s.
Our Customs and Border Protection -- and these people, the job they do is incredible -- seized nearly 1,500 pounds of fentanyl last year, nearly three times the amount seized in 2016. And I told China: Dont send it.  And I told Mexico: Dont send it. Dont send it.
In 2017, ICE arrested criminal aliens with 76,000 charges and convictions for dangerous drug crimes.
Last year, the Department of Justice prosecuted more than 3,000 defendants in cases involving opioid, all of the trafficking, and the related crimes -- 3,000 cases -- including a pharmacist, a physicians assistant, and an opioid trafficker, each charged with committing serious drug crimes in New Hampshire.
Whether you are a dealer or doctor or trafficker or a manufacturer, if you break the law and illegally peddle these deadly poisons, we will find you, we will arrest you, and we will hold you accountable.  Thank you.
Here in New Hampshire, I applaud all of the Drug Enforcement Agents and law enforcement officers who recently coordinated Operation Granite Shield, an 18-hour enforcement action targeting drug traffickers that resulted in the arrest of 151 people.
These are terrible people, and we have to get tough on those people, because we can have all the Blue Ribbon committees we want, but if we dont get tough on the drug dealers, were wasting our time. Just remember that. Were wasting our time. And that toughness includes the death penalty.
You know, its an amazing thing. Some of these drug dealers will kill thousands of people during their lifetime -- thousands of people -- and destroy many more lives than that.
But they will kill thousands of people during their lifetime, and theyll get caught and theyll get 30 days in jail. Or theyll go away for a year, or theyll be fined. And yet, if you kill one person, you get the death penalty or you go to jail for life.
So if were not going to get tough on the drug dealers who kills thousands of people and destroy so many peoples lives, we are just doing the wrong thing. We have got to get tough.
This isnt about nice anymore. This isnt about committees. This isnt about lets get everybody and have dinners, and lets have everybody go to a Blue Ribbon committee and everybody gets a medal for, frankly, talking and doing nothing. This is about winning a very, very tough problem. And if we dont get very tough on these dealers, its not going to happen, folks. Its not going to happen. And I want to win this battle.
I dont want to leave at the end of seven years and have this problem, okay?  I dont want that. Right? Thank you. Not going to happen. Thank you all. A lot of voters in this room. I see that. Thank you.  No, were going to solve this problem.
Were going to solve it with brains, were going to solve it with resolve, and were going to solve it with toughness. Because toughness is the thing that they most fear. Thats what they most fear. So to the brave agents and officers, thank you for protecting us all.
Last year, my commission on combatting the incredible crisis of opioids issued 56 recommendations. My administration agreed with all of the commissions goals, and weve worked aggressively to put them into action.
Today, Im here to announce additional steps that were taking as part of our nationwide initiative to address the opioid crisis, and, by the way, the drug crisis -- the general drug crisis.
First, were taking action to reduce drug demand by preventing Americans from becoming addicted in the first place. So important. That includes increasing federal funding for the development of non-addictive painkillers. And we have to come up with a solution where we come up with a painkiller thats not so addictive. And we can do it. Were not that far off. We can do it. These things are incredibly addictive. So were going to find that answer also.
Here with us today are Jim and Jean Mozer. They lost their beautiful son, Adam, to a fentanyl overdose. His addiction began with prescription pills he found in their kitchen cabinet. They have since begun the Zero Left initiative to help families get rid of excess painkillers.
Jim and Jean, were sorry for your loss -- a great boy; hes a great boy -- and we applaud your strength and your leadership. And where are you? Where are you? Come on up. Come on up here. Come on up here.  Tell us about your boy.
Adam was our oldest son. He was a great kid. He was a smart kid. Grew up out in rural East Kingston, New Hampshire. He had a degree in actuarial science, which, as many of you know, thats the science of forecasting risk.
He was the kind of kid that made you feel really good about yourself. You give him five minutes; you really liked him. And, you know, he just made a bad choice one night. As smart as he was, he found his way into our kitchen cabinet.
And, sadly, the rest is history. He got hooked on it, and had to go to the street eventually. And he found fentanyl. And hes been gone for two-and-a-half years, and we miss him every day. Thank you.
Thank you, darling. You take care of yourself. Okay?
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you very much.  Thank you. Appreciate it. And so many cases like that. Were also taking action to prevent addiction by addressing the problem of overprescribing.
And our Department of Justice is looking very seriously into bringing major litigation against some of these drug companies. Well bring it at a federal level.  Some states are already bringing it, but were thinking about bringing it at a very high federal level. And well do a job.
Were going to cut nationwide opioid prescriptions by one-third over the next three years. Were also going to make sure that virtually all prescriptions reimbursed by the federal government follow best practices for prescribing. Well ensure that opioid addiction is not subsidized by the American taxpayer.
The best way -- so important -- and the best way to beat the drug crisis is to keep people from getting hooked on drugs to begin with. As part of that effort --  -- so important.
And this has been something that Ive been very strongly in favor of: spending a lot of money on great commercials showing how bad it is, so that kids seeing those commercials during the right shows on television or wherever -- the Internet -- when they see these commercials they -- I dont want any part of it.
Thats the least expensive thing we can do, where you scare them from ending up like the people in the commercials. And well make them very, very bad commercials. Well make them pretty unsavory situations. And youve seen it before, and its had an impact on smoking and cigarettes. You see what happens to the body; you see what happens to the mind.
So were announcing a new website, CrisisNextDoor.gov, where Americans can share their stories about the danger of the opioid addiction and addictions.
But were thinking about doing, really, a largescale rollout of commercials that show how bad it is for the kids. And when they see those commercials, hopefully, theyre not going to be going to drugs of any kind -- drugs of any kind. And well save a lot of lives, and well make their life a lot easier.
This epidemic can affect anyone, and thats why we want to educate everyone.
The second part of our initiative is to reduce the supply of illicit drugs. Ninety percent of the heroin in America comes from our southern border, where, eventually, the Democrats will agree with us and well build the wall to keep the damn drugs out.

Its pretty amazing. They dont want to go with DACA, because they dont care about DACA. But theyre trying to tie the wall to DACA, and DACA to the wall. And they want to keep DACA for the campaign instead of getting it approved, which we could do very easily.
