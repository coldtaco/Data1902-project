Donald Trump|Donald Trump Vlog: The United Nations|September 23, 2018
Next week, Im going to be at the United Nations in New York, and Ive always said the United Nations has tremendous potential. But it has not lived up to that potential.
Its always been surprising to me that more things arent resolved, because you have all of these countries getting together in one location, but it doesnt seem to get there. I think it will.
