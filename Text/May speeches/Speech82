Section 19 of the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act 2011  requires the Secretary of State to report to Parliament as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of every relevant three-month period on the exercise of her TPIM powers under the Act during that period.
The level of information provided will always be subject to slight variations based on operational advice.
During the reporting period: one TPIM notice was imposed; no TPIM notices were extended; no TPIM notices were revoked; and no TPIM notices were revived.
A TPIM Review Group  keeps every TPIM notice under regular and formal review. The TPIM Review Group met twice during this reporting period.
No individuals were charged in relation to an offence under section 23 of the Act  during the period.
