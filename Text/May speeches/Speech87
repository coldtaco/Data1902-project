Theresa May|Theresa Mays speech on publication of the Violence Against Women and Girls Action Plan 2013|7 March 2013
This written ministerial statement was laid in the House of Commons on 7 March 2013 by Theresa May, and in the House of Lords by Lord Taylor of Holbeach.
Tomorrow, on International Womenâ€™s Day, the government is publishing an updated violence against women and girls Action Plan. A copy will be placed in the House Library.
Last year around 1.2 million women suffered domestic abuse and around 400,000 were sexually assaulted. This is wholly unacceptable. We are determined, not just to reduce, but to end violence against women and girls.
Two and a half years ago we set out our strategy to end violence against women and girls. Our key themes of prevention, provision of good quality services, improved partnership working, better justice outcomes and risk reduction remain as relevant today as when we first agreed our approach.
This Action Plan updates the efforts underpinning that strategy, and sets out significant progress since the last report was published a year ago. We are also alive to new and emerging issues and the updated plan includes a renewed focus on challenging the attitudes that foster violence against women and girls.
We are proud of the progress this government has made in protecting the lives of women and girls, but there is still much more to do. This Action Plan confirms our ongoing commitment to stop the violence and abuse which blights the lives of too many women and girls.
