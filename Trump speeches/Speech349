Donald Trump|Interview: Bill O'Reilly of Fox News Interviews Donald Trump|February 5, 2017
Caution, you are about to enter the No Spin Zone, THE FACTOR begins right now.
Hi, I am Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching us tonight. As you may know, my interview with President Trump making headlines all over the world. And tonight, we will show you what you did not see in the Super Bowl pregame show. Here is what happened. We interviewed the President on Friday afternoon, at the White House. The interview ran about 40 minutes. Ten of which were used by FOX Sports.
So, that leaves us with half an hour. To show you tonight and tomorrow. The headlines out of the Super Bowl interview where Mr. Trump comments on the Russian and Putin and the anti-ObamaCare roll-up. It's interesting to watch our two competing cable news stations, which hate, hate Mr. Trump to an unhealthy degree. Try to analyze what the President told me. I thought Donald Trump was straightforward and honest in that interview, whether you like his answers or not.
But the Trump haters were trying desperately to find something with which to hammer the President. Also apparently the Putin administration in Moscow demanding that I, your humble correspondent, apologized for saying old blood is a killer. So, I am working on that apology, but it may take a little time. Might want to check in with me around 2023. In a conference call with reporters, Putin's press guy said this. [Begin Video Clip]
[Via Translator] We think words like that coming from the FOX correspondent are unacceptable, offensive, and to be honest, we would prefer to get an apology to the President coming from such a respected company. [End Video Clip]
