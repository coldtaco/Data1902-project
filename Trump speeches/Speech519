Donald Trump|Remarks: Donald Trump and Mike Pence Speak Briefly After Arriving in Cleveland|July 20, 2016
Thank you everybody. This is really an honor. We're going to win Ohio, right? Come here, Mike. We're going to win Ohio. We're going to win it all. Going to Make America Great Again. That's what we want to do. But the last time I got accused of speaking a little bit long, so this time we have to speak a lot short.
But I just want to introduce a man who's become a friend of mine. Somebody who is going to make an unbelievable vice president of the United States, Governor Mike Pence.
Thank you, Don. Let's hear it for the next president of the United States of America, Donald Trump. It is such an honor to join your family to welcome you to Cleveland. We're excited to hear you address the nation tomorrow night. It's been exciting to hear from your family more to come tonight. And I'm convinced, what begins in Cleveland will end in the White House.
Thank you and God bless you. And welcome to Cleveland.
